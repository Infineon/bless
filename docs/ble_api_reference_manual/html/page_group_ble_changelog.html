<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th><b>Version</b></th><th><b>Changes</b></th><th><b>Reason for Change</b> </th></tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="3">5.0.7.196 </td><td>Updated the APIs to handle the interrupt locking. </td><td>A better locking mechanism to avoid potential timing-sensitive bugs.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Re-factored the radio initialization sequence. </td><td>It was observed that on customer boards, re-factoring the radio initialization sequence provided an improved stability to the reset sequence.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Fix for CVE-2019-16336. </td><td><p class="starttd">Enforced the length check on incoming LL PDUs to protect against buffer overflows caused by malicious packets. Malformed Data packets will be dropped in the LL. Malformed Control packets will be replied with LL_UNKNOWN_RSP. For detail, refer to the <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-16336">CVE-2019-16336</a> vulnerability page.  </p>
<p class="endtd"></p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="3">5.0.6.161 </td><td>Updated the radio configuration. </td><td>To support the new packages: QFN68 and BGA124.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Added checks for Malformed LL PDUs. </td><td>LL PDUs with the incorrect length must be replied with LL_UNKNOWN_RSP per latest BLE spec. Also, this prevents against any unknown behavior triggered due to malicious LL PDUs.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Documentation update. </td><td><p class="starttd">Updated the documentation for the CY_BLE_EVT_RADIO_TEMPERATURE and CY_BLE_EVT_RADIO_VOLTAGE_LEVEL events. </p>
<p class="endtd"></p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="7">5.0.5.110 </td><td>Optimized the ACL TX path for a better throughput. </td><td>The throughput was observed to be low when the stack libraries were linked with MDK libraries.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Added support for autonomous feature exchange on connection complete. </td><td>Few mobile phone (eg. Droid Turbo) negotiate DLE with TX octets &gt; 27 bytes but do not actually support the DLE feature. This leads to interoperability issues with such phones. An autonomous feature exchange will be triggered when the PSoC 6 device is in master role, and the DLE and PHY update negotiations will be triggered only if the peer supports DLE/PHY update feature. In case PSoC 6 is in a slave role, DLE/PHY update negotiations will not be triggered till the peer initiates a feature exchange procedure and hence exchanges it's feature set.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Added support for configurable PA LDO settings. </td><td>It was observed that on customer boards, the output RF TX power was sub-optimal, when the factory settings for PA LDO were used. To fine tune the PA LDO settings at the customer end, the same were now exposed via the paCalConfig member of stackConfig input structure to the Cy_BLE_StackInit API.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Updated RSSI formula. </td><td>With the previous formula, there existed a non-linearity in the measured value of RSSI at ~ -50dBm.   </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>The SoC mode library was split into three libraries: host, controller and stack manager. </td><td>The new organization structure allows usage of the same controller library with BLESS host, a UART application or any third party host, over a software HCI interface.   </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Fixed issue with disconnection. </td><td>If an LL procedure is on-going, and a disconnect command is issued, the Terminate PDU is not transmitted over the air even after the procedure completes.   </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Updated Cy_BLE_StackInit API to check that if DLE is disabled, max TX and RX octets must be set to 27 Bytes. </td><td><p class="starttd">The check for the DLE parameters was not correct for the case when DLE is disabled. </p>
<p class="endtd"></p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="4">5.0.4.946 </td><td>Fix for CVE-2019-17061. </td><td>Updated the handling of LL PDU with LLID 0 to prevent corruption in subsequently received LL PDUs. Such packets will be dropped in the LL, but the peer will be acked for the packet. For detail, refer to the <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17061">CVE-2019-17061</a> vulnerability page.  </td></tr>

<td>Enabled the RSSI reading after the CRC has been received. </td><td>The RSSI value was not being updated if deep sleep was enabled in the controller.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Optimized the ACL TX path for a better throughput. </td><td>In BLE dual CPU mode, with CM0p running at 25 MHz, the BLE throughput was observed to be sub-optimal.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Added support for the PDL APIs to calculate temperature and Battery monitor output. </td><td><p class="starttd">New APIs were added to the PDL to calculate the absolute values of the die temperature and radio voltage, using the raw values from the radio. </p>
<p class="endtd"></p>
